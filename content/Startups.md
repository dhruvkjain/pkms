### Ideas:
- General purpose open source GPU programming framework
	- Right now Nvidia have monopoly on how chips are made and used. Nvidia chips have CUDA framework for their GPU programming, they don't need to follow standards so that it is compatible and editable by others
- Log Ingestor (its a bit common still not generalized as it's hard to create a general ingestor)
- A Federated Federated Reinforcement Learning CPU Task Scheduler that can be used in organizations wide computers to maximize the efficiency.
