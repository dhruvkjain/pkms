SIMD = Single Instruction Multiple Data 

In GPU we have SIMT i.e. Single Instruction Multiple Threads (32 threads per wrap/group), where each thread can access same or different data

let's say we have a if statement if A else B then, a SIMT compiler will map that to a predication/predicate mask(a bitmask or a set of boolean values). Each value of predication mask represents a case where condition is true or false according to the boolean value it holds.
`true` or `1` means operation proceeds
`false` or `0` means operation is skipped
