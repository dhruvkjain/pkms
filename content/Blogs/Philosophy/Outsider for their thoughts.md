When you stand next to strong person, you don't feel weak, you just admire their strength. When you meet someone rich you don't feel personally attacked, you just admire their progress and aspire to achieve something  similar. In both cases we feel a bit envy but it's not personal, not like they are imposing there superiority.
But when you meet a deep thinker, "Mirror Effect" occur where they not only introduces new ideas, perspectives, but also reflect the limitations of those around them. The mere presence of a deep thinker makes you feel inadequate.

Strength, Wealth, Beauty are external we recognize them but they don't necessarily challenge our core self-perception.
Unlike Physical Strength or material wealth, Intelligence is tied to a persons identity, self-perception.
**When we meet someone that questions what we take for granted or don't dare to question, we feel a direct attack to our self-perception, our identity.** 
*Presence of deep thinkers forces others to confront their own limitations.*

People tend to resist such people because of the mirror effect therefore *society is more influenced by charismatic but simplistic thinkers than deep thinkers who speak with nuance.*

In one-one conversation with an intellect, people feel less insecure but in group conversation people are worried about there social status, they try to exclude the deep thinker to protect their social standing.

*"The Dunning-Kruger Effect" -> people with low-ability often overestimate their intelligence, while highly intelligent people tend to doubt themselves.*

 *"Arthur Schopenhauer" -> Intelligence is not a gift but a curse.*
 Most people live their lives controlled by their **will to live** meaning they seek pleasure, comfort and survival above all else. However, highly intelligent people, instead of following their instincts develop the **will to truth**, a desire to understand reality even if comes with discomfort. 

While most people find meaning in relationships, entertainment and routine pleasures, deep tinkers often see them as distractions from the deeper truth.

So instead of seeking validation from society, deep thinkers should embrace solitude and isolation and consider it a privilege.

People who can deliver more simpler, emotional and instant content without any depth gets more attention which kind of chambers a person into beliefs and perspectives of the content they consume.

*"Socrates" -> The unexamined life is not worth living.*
