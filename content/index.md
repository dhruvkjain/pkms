Hi, [Dhruv](https://dhruvkjain.vercel.app/) here

This is a personal knowledge management system ([pkms](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/)) formally but I use this to document my understanding and organize the resources I found while learning (almost) everything I know. It contains random methods and websites, videos, books etc. I keep all this here for easy access and reference.
