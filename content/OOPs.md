### 4 Pillars: 
- **Encapsulation** => encapsulating functions and variable having same objective into a single unit (often function or object)
- **Abstraction** => Showing only relevant data / functions and hiding implementations (like private and public functions and data)
- **Inheritance** => eliminate redundant code by reusing code (creating a prototype) 
- **Polymorphism** => using same symbol to represent multiple functionalities

class => user defined datatypes
private, protected, public => access modifiers

dynamic dispatch => runtime, heap allocation
static dispatch => compile time, stack allocation, not in the same stack frame as local variables
