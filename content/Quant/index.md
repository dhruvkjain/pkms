		- The empirical work presented in the blogpost is very interesting (congrats to all involved). I want to add to the discussion by mentioning that diffusion models will always under-characterize tail probabilities when your target (e.g. equity returns) is heavy-tailed. This is a mathematical result proven in our recent paper (Tam and Dunson [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07763))
