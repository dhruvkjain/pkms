Here I have summarized the "Architecture Exploration of FPGA Based Accelerators for BioInformatics Applicaitons" published by Springer publications.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

**Microprocessors**: same hardware run multiple types of stored programs, based on Von Neumann Architecture.
**Hardware Accelerators**: augmented with processors to run compute extensive, made up of small execution units that facilitates parallel execution.
Parallel execution is achieved by transformation of loops in a sequential code (temporal iteration) to spatial unrolling of the loop (spatial iteration).
**Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)**: specialized custom designed circuits.

Hardware Accelerators like FPGA, GPU, CELL etc. are programmable but have fixed
